See [Keyboard.Events.DOWN]{@linkcode Phaser.Input.Keyboard.Events#event:DOWN} for details.\r\n * \r\n * _Note_: Many keyboards are unable to process certain combinations of keys due to hardware limitations known as ghosting.\r\n * Read [this article on ghosting]{@link http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/4876-impossible-to-use-more-than-2-keyboard-input-buttons-at-the-same-time/} for details.\r\n *\r\n * Also, please be aware that some browser extensions can disable or override Phaser keyboard handling.\r\n * For example, the Chrome extension vimium is known to disable Phaser from using the D key, while EverNote disables the backtick key.\r\n * There are others.
