[GAMEOBJECT_POINTER_OVER]{@linkcode Phaser.Input.Events#event:GAMEOBJECT_POINTER_OVER}\r\n * 2. [GAMEOBJECT_OVER]{@linkcode Phaser.Input.Events#event:GAMEOBJECT_OVER}\r\n * 3. [POINTER_OVER]{@linkcode Phaser.Input.Events#event:POINTER_OVER}\r\n * \r\n * With the top event being dispatched first and then flowing down the list.

You can call `stopPropagation()` to halt it from going any further in the event flow.\r\n */\r\nmodule.exports = 'pointerover';\r\n"},"lineCount":null}},"error":null,"hash":"2caa28cbdca8bcb4e2b7c1a87ffaed42","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
