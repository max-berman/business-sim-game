[GAMEOBJECT_POINTER_DOWN]{@linkcode Phaser.Input.Events#event:GAMEOBJECT_POINTER_DOWN}\r\n * 2. [GAMEOBJECT_DOWN]{@linkcode Phaser.Input.Events#event:GAMEOBJECT_DOWN}\r\n * 3. [POINTER_DOWN]{@linkcode Phaser.Input.Events#event:POINTER_DOWN} or [POINTER_DOWN_OUTSIDE]{@linkcode Phaser.Input.Events#event:POINTER_DOWN_OUTSIDE}\r\n * \r\n * With the top event being dispatched first and then flowing down the list.
