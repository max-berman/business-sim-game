See the [BUTTON_UP]{@linkcode Phaser.Input.Gamepad.Events#event:BUTTON_UP} event for details.\r\n *\r\n * @event Phaser.Input.Gamepad.Events#GAMEPAD_BUTTON_UP\r\n * @since 3.10.0\r\n * \r\n * @param {integer} index - The index of the button that was released.\r\n * @param {number} value - The value of the button at the time it was released.
