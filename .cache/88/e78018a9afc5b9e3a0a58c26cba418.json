[GAMEOBJECT_POINTER_WHEEL]{@linkcode Phaser.Input.Events#event:GAMEOBJECT_POINTER_WHEEL}\r\n * 2. [GAMEOBJECT_WHEEL]{@linkcode Phaser.Input.Events#event:GAMEOBJECT_WHEEL}\r\n * 3. [POINTER_WHEEL]{@linkcode Phaser.Input.Events#event:POINTER_WHEEL}\r\n * \r\n * With the top event being dispatched first and then flowing down the list.

This value will typically be less than 0 if the user scrolls up and greater than zero if scrolling down.\r\n * @param {number} deltaZ - The z-axis scroll amount that occurred due to the user moving a mouse wheel or similar input device.\r\n * @param {Phaser.Types.Input.EventData} event - The Phaser input event. You can call `stopPropagation()` to halt it from going any further in the event flow.\r\n */\r\nmodule.exports = 'gameobjectwheel';\r\n"},"lineCount":null}},"error":null,"hash":"651d8f32bdb799da5d2859cee398afa0","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
